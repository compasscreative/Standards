URLs

- The primary site domain should not include the `www`. For example, use `compasscreative.ca` instead of `www.compasscreative.ca`.
- Where possible, please exclude the trailing slash from all page urls. For example, use `compasscreative.ca/about` instead of `compasscreative.ca/about/`.
- Please `301 redirect` any old page links to new pages. This is important for SEO purposes, and also prevents broken incoming links from other websites.
